title: These 7 Newsletters Are A Must Read For All Designers
width: wide
---

As a designer, I am always taking in different sources of inspiration to fuel my creative work. Newsletters in particular are a great source of knowledge and ideas. They contain curated articles, design tips, mental models, and links to design resources I would never have found otherwise.

Because I get so much value from the newsletters I'm subscribed to, I wanted to write this article to share with you the 7 best newsletters I've come across to help you on your journey as a designer. 

Each section outlines a different newsletter: what it's about, how often it's sent out, and my favorite edition to give you a taste of what it has to offer. I hope you find some hidden gems here to add to your newsletter collection.
