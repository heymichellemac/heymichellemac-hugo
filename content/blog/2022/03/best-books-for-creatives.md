title: These 7 Books Will Change How You Think About Being A Creative
---

I read some great books in 2021 that changed completely how I think about my creative practice, how I create, and how I get things done.

Before reading these books I had no system for creating, no way of managing my work, and no idea that I could create things others would find helpful. Slowly but surely, reading each book and applying what I learned has resulted in the creative practice that I live each day. I couldn't imagine working any differently.

Here are 7 of the best books all creatives should read this year:

---

## 1 The Accidental Creative

- What creative constraints are and how you can use them to improve your creativity.

### The Book In 3 Ideas

1. Creative productivity comes in ebbs and flows. Some days we can be very creative but other days we can't think of anything creative or worthwhile.
2. A regular creative practice will help to develop your creativity muscle so you can generate creative insights on demand.

## 3 A Whack On The Side Of The Head

Author: Roger Von Oech

### What You'll Learn

- How to unlock the mental locks that limit your creativity. Once you learn this you'll find it so much easier to create.

- How to generate creative ideas. The secret sauce of being creative.

### The Book In 3 Ideas

1. Simply knowing something doesn't make you creative. What makes you creative is what you do with that knowledge.
2. In school, we are taught to find the right answer. This implies there is only one right answer. However, in life, there are many right answers.
3. Sometimes a failure can serve as a stepping stone to the right idea. Focus on what worked and understand what didn't.
