title: How Regular Reflection Makes You A Better Designer
width: wide
---

Constantly moving from one project to the next leaves little time to think about the big picture. It can be tough to find the time to ask yourself questions like:

- Am I making progress towards my goals?
- What even are my goals?
- Am I doing work that I enjoy?

Without a practice of reflection, you forget about the great accomplishments you've made.

Instead, you give in to your negativity bias and only remember the slip-ups and mistakes you made.

> **Here's why regular reflection makes you a better designer:**

- Documenting your accomplishments will motivate you. When work gets tough you can look to your positive experiences to light a fire under you.
- Journaling at the end of each day can lead to new insights. You'll find interesting insights in old journal entries that you can use in current projects.
- Noting your workload, stress, and energy levels help to manage them. You can remove things that cause stress and learn when your energy levels are at their highest.
- Over time you will learn how much work you can get done in a day. This allows you to plan your day in advance.
- If you've had a bad week, you can course-correct to improve next week. Small but intentional improvements over time will help you become even more successful.
