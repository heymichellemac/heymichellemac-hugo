title: How I Consume Content To Build A Massively Helpful Vault Of Knowledge
width: wide
---

Over the last year, I've developed a system for how I consume different types of content. 

This system has allowed me to build a vault of knowledge I can repurpose into articles, newsletters, tweets, and digital products. 

Here's my system:

## Consuming Articles 
1. I clip articles using the **[Save to Notion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm)** extension. This organizes articles into a Library Notion DB with helpful metadata like the name, source URL, status, and content type.
2. I read the article directly in **[Notion](notion.so)**, make highlights, and take rough notes.
3. I further refine my notes into **[Obsidian](obsidian.md)** literature notes. 
4. Finally, I process these literature notes into evergreen notes. These are atomic notes I can draw from when writing.

## Consuming Books
1. I read books on my phone using the **Google Play Books** app. As I make highlights and notes, these are saved to a **Google Doc**.
2. When I finish reading, I create a new entry in my Library Notion DB. I review the notes and highlights from the Google Doc and make my own notes.
3. As with articles, I further refine these notes into Obsidian literature notes, then process them into evergreen notes.

## Consuming Podcasts
1. I listen to podcasts using the **[Snipd](https://www.snipd.com/)** app. This allows me to highlight interesting moments as I listen. This has been a game-changer.
2. I export these snips into my Library Notion DB and make my own notes.
3. Next, you guessed it, I refine these notes into Obsidian literature notes, then evergreen notes. 

## Consuming Videos 
1. I watch videos on **YouTube** and take notes in my Library Notion DB.
2. I refine these notes into Obsidian literature notes, then evergreen notes.

The multiple iterations of note-taking and note-refining results in better notes that I'm more inclined to remember.
