title: Erasable pens make writing by hand delightful again

![Erasable Pens & Highlighters](/assets/images/2023/MXA23007/erasable-pens.jpg){:style="width:450px"}

This set of erasable pens and highlighters I bought has really encouraged me to keep up with my journaling practice. 

The pens themselves are super cute and pretty comfortable to write with. They come in a variety of styles and ink colors. 

They work surprisingly well. No messy whiteout/tippex to ruin my page. The ink is heat/friction sensitive so using the eraser tip of the pen is all you need to remove any writing mistakes.

I bought these from an Italian website called [Legami](https://www.legami.com/en_en/stationery/writing/erasable-pens.html) and I'm already pondering a second order of stationery.
