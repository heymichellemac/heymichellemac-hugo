title: How To Never Be Bored Again
width: wide
---

Feeling "bored" can result in a complete lack of motivation. You don't have the drive to pick something from your list of chores. You can't bring yourself to do anything except watch YouTube mindlessly.

At the same time, at the back of your mind is a small sense of guilt. A sense that you should be doing something more valuable with your time. Something creative or constructive.

If this sounds like you, you're not alone. It's something I used to struggle with. 

There are still some days where this feeling does strike.

However, I've found a way to overcome boredom and to find value in the things I create and do each day.

## Boredom Isn't All Bad

I want to note here that boredom isn't all bad. There are times where you should absolutely allow yourself to be bored:

- Spend time sitting and doing nothing 
- Go for a walk without headphones 
- Go somewhere without your phone

This free time is beneficial to your mind and your mental health.

Not only will your brain be able to connect ideas and solve problems, but you'll feel a lot calmer and happier as a result.

However, when you find yourself completely lacking in motivation over a week or so, that's when things tend to go too far the other way.

## Pick One: Create Or Consume

Here's my secret to never be bored again. Pick one item from this list and go do it:

1. Create 
2. Consume

It's as simple as that, you don't need to overcomplicate things.

### Create

There are so many things you can create. 

Sit down and create a mind map of things you would like to create.

You've just created something!

Use the positive momentum of creating something fun to keep you motivated and engaged.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Create a mind map of projects you'd like to work on.
- Create a website mockup based on your favorite book, podcast, hobby, pet.
- Build that website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Build something to develop your coding knowledge. 
  - I found a great idea that I want to try out sometime in the future: creating a Kanto Pokedex in React JS.
- Create a video based on a topic you find interesting.
- Record yourself having a discussion with a friend or family member.
- Create something that solves a problem you have.

If you want to add a little more structure to your "create" time, add a time in your calendar each week for [scheduled creativity](/schedule-time-for-creativity).

### Consume

When I say consume I mean things like reading and listening.

When you actively consume, you're gaining knowledge that you can use in interesting ways.

You can even take what you learn from the content you consume and use it during your "create" time.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Read a book you wouldn't normally pick. If you enjoy non-fiction, give a fiction book a try.
- Listen to a podcast on a topic that interests you.
- Watch a YouTube video that teaches you how to do something.
- Start an online course that teaches you something new.
- Join the library so you can check out books and audiobooks for free.
- Watch a documentary on something you'd like to learn more about.

## Take It To The Next Level: Combine Create + Consume

If you want to take things to the next level, combine create and consume.

Use the knowledge you gain from the things you consume to influence what you create.

- When you finish your online course about starting a podcast, start a podcast based on your love of Pok√©mon, or Web Development, or Gaming.
- Based on what you learned from the documentary you watched, create a blog post or a YouTube video.
- After listening to a number of audiobooks, start sharing your thoughts on social media to see who else has similar opinions.

If you share what you create and consume online, you can build an audience of people that enjoy your work.

In addition to never being bored again, you'll also have a community to engage with.

## Conclusion

To summarize, if you never want to experience boredom again, choose to either create or consume.

Make each of these activities part of your routine and you might even find some added benefits that you hadn't considered before.
