I created this website as a result of a pain point I had at work with needing to count the characters present in a form field. 

More specifically, we needed to verify form validation and needed an easy way to count characters and generate a specific number of characters.

I thought this would be a great little project to work on during my [weekly scheduled creative time](/scheduled-creative-time).

The end result is a character counter, character generator, and Lorem Ipsum generator.

I built this site using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's deployed to GitHub and hosted on Netlify.

This was an enjoyable project to work on as it gave me the chance to brush up on my JavaScript knowledge. I also had the chance to try out dark mode using Tailwind CSS for the first time.
