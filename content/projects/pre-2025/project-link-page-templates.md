A selection of three different starter link page templates.

Link pages are incredibly useful to link to from your social media accounts so people can easily find your most important links.

I initially created these templates to practice my web dev skills and over time found them to be a really handy starting point for making new sites.

Over time I realized others may find these templates useful so I decided to package together my favorite three examples and sell them here!

What you get when you purchase this is:

- A set of 3 different templates created in HTML and Tailwind CSS.
- Each template contains a low code and med/high code approach as well as a link to a guide to deploy each site on Netlify.

Here's the readme to give you a better idea of how each template works:

### Low code approach

To edit the links on the page, open `public > index.html` in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text for example.)

Update the links to your own websites and save.

The **public** directory is where the fully-built website lives.

If you want to quickly deploy the website on Netlify, simply [drag and drop that directory into a new site](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop).

### Med/High code approach

Follow this approach if you want to tweak the styling or structure of the page.

Install dependencies
`npm install`

Run the project
`npm run dev`

Build the project for prod
`npm run prod`

Then you can deploy using the same method as above or using your own deployment process.
