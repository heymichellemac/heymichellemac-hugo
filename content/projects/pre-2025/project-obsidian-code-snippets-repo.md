A GitHub repo of Obsidian code snippets that I use in my Obsidian vault.

I use Obsidian as my PKM system so I have it open pretty much every day. This means that over time I've set up various templates and systems to use Obsidian more efficiently for my creative practice.

I created this repo to serve as a public space for all my Obsidian templates and code snippets. Hopefully it will help you or give you some inspiration if you're looking to set up similar templates for yourself.
