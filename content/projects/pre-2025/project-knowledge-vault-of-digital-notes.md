## Knowledge Vault Of My Digital Notes

Being an active consumer of books and web articles has allowed me to do so much:

- By writing great notes in my own words and synthesizing ideas in ways that I can understand, I have become a smarter person in all of the areas that interest me.

- By having a great library of knowledge with lots of connections, I never have to start writing my articles from scratch. This makes the process of creating content so much more enjoyable.

- By sharing my thoughts and ideas that come from my literature notes, I can gather great feedback from others and build an audience of people that are interested in what I am talking about.

Reading How To Take Smart Notes by SÃ¶nke Ahrens and How To Read A Book by Mortimer Adler truly changed how I consume information and learn from it.

As a result of this, I have developed a knowledge vault of hand-crafted literature notes. These notes summarize and synthesize all of the key ideas and concepts discussed in what Iâ€™ve read.

Now that my knowledge vault has grown in size, I would like to share it with you so you can have a wealth of knowledge to draw from however you choose to use it.

Here are some things you can make use of these notes:

- Use these literature notes to form the start of your own Zettelkasten or Evergreen notes system.
- Skim over a book note to see if itâ€™s worth reading the whole book for yourself
- If you donâ€™t want to read an entire book, you have a concise summary to hand to read through
- Learn about new topics or concepts that you didnâ€™t know about before
- Find other interesting recommendations for books or articles to read
