In this book, I share with you everything I've learned as a productive designer over the last 10 years. 

From design concepts to productivity tips and advice, you'll learn everything you need to improve your designs and work more effectively.

The information is broken down in an easy-to-understand way and each section is accompanied by relevant imagery to give you an even clearer picture of what's being discussed.

### Who Is This Book For?

This book is for you if you are new to design or have a basic knowledge of design and want to become more productive.

It contains the basics to get you started with design, advice for improving your designs, as well as tips and strategies for developing a healthy approach to productivity.

**You don’t need to be a designer to read and appreciate this information.**

As a content creator, coder, or writer, knowing how to present your work in a visually appealing way is an invaluable way to build an engaged following.

If people like how your content looks, if it makes people stop scrolling for that split second to see your post, if it changes the way someone thinks about something, that’s half the battle.
