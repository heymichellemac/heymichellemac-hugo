Hi, I'm Michelle ðŸ‘‹ I'm a technical writer and front-end developer based in Ireland. I'm currently working as a senior technical writer at Red Hat. I specialize in making complex technical concepts clear and useful.

When I'm not writing documentation, youâ€™ll probably find me playing video games, crocheting something cozy, or tending to my ever-growing collection of plants.

You can find all of my articles and notes in the [Blog](/blog), and if you're curious about what I've been building, check out the [Projects](/projects) section. I've also compiled a list of my favorite apps, gear, and workflows under [Tools I Use](/tools-i-use).
