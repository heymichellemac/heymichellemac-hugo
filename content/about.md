Hi, my name is Michelle ðŸ‘‹ I'm a technical writer and front-end developer based in Ireland. I'm currently working as a senior technical writer at Red Hat.

In my own time I write on this website, work on fun web-based projects, contibute to open source, and play video games.

All of my writing can be found under the [Blog](/blog) section. If you want to see all of the projects I've worked on, head over to the [Projects](/projects) section. A list of all the tools I use can be found under [Tools I Use](/tools-i-use).
