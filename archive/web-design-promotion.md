title: 4 Tactics You Should Be Using To Promote Yourself As A Web Designer
width: wide
---

Do you want to become a full-time web designer but aren't sure where to start?

I have tried every tactic to promote myself as a web designer over the last 10 years. I started websites to promote my services, created sites for my friends and family, I even applied (and failed) to lots of different web design companies.

Through all those attempts and failures, I learned what does work. Tactics you can apply today to help you promote yourself as a Web Designer. Let me share these tactics with you so that you can avoid all the mistakes I made and get started faster.

## Tactic #1: Share Who You Are

It's important to share with potential clients and employers who you are.

You can easily share this information by creating an About page on your website. If you don't have a website, you can set up a single page using [Carrd](https://carrd.co/), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) that accomplishes the same thing. Include a photo, tell people who you are, what you do, and what experience you have.  

When people know who you are and what you do best, you become more credible. 

## Tactic #2: Showcase Your Work

Here's a saying you may have heard before: "Show, don't tell".

People looking to hire you want to see your previous work to get a sense of your ability. You can achieve this by creating a portfolio of your best work. The best 5 - 10 pieces that show your skills. Again, you could add this to your personal website or use tools like [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) or [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) to create an online portfolio.

Once you have a solid portfolio, it becomes an invaluable asset for you to promote yourself with.

## Tactic #3: Demonstrate Your Knowledge

Being able to share your knowledge will add to your credibility as a competent web designer.

Thanks to the internet, there are so many ways to share your knowledge with the world. You could start a blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), or [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), start a YouTube channel, or start a Podcast. The medium you choose is completely up to you and what you're most comfortable doing.

Once you've decided and set up your channel, share what you know and what you learn with others.

## Tactic #4: Be Contactable

If people can't contact you, all your promotion will be for nothing.

Have at least 1 reliable way for people to reach out to you. It doesn't need to be a phone number or email, it's perfectly acceptable to say "DM me on Twitter if you'd like to collaborate". Pick a contact method, tell others how to contact you, and check it regularly.

Don't over-complicate this one with lots of different email addresses and funnels, just pick something simple and stick with it.

**If you implement these 4 tactics today, you'll become a more credible web designer.**

As you can see, they aren't overly complicated and can all be done for FREE.
